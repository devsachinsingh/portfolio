  intro: "At my core, I am a cultivator—whether I'm nurturing a complex codebase or a young sapling in the soil.",
  bio: [
    "I believe that nature is the ultimate architect. While I spend my days building digital structures in the iOS ecosystem, I find my true balance with my hands in the earth. To me, nature isn't just a place to visit; it's home, and it’s where I go to find clarity and perspective.",
    "My philosophy is simple: we should leave every place better than we found it. This applies to the legacy code I inherit, the teams I lead, and, most importantly, the planet we share. I feel a deep responsibility to contribute to a greener future, and I find the most purpose when my work aligns with the health of our Mother Earth.",
    "I am a quiet advocate for the environment, a seeker of green spaces, and a believer in technology that serves humanity without costing the planet. I am at my best when I am creating with intention, working toward a world where tech and nature can thrive in harmony.",
