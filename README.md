## 📖 About
This portfolio was built to bridge the gap between **Native Mobile Engineering** and **Modern Web Development**. It features a clean, "Apple-like" aesthetic with smooth scroll animations, a responsive bento-grid layout, and a centralized data architecture.

It serves as a showcase for my work as an **iOS Lead Engineer**, highlighting projects in Swift, SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose, and AI integration.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Next.js 14 (App Router):** Server-side rendering for optimal SEO and performance.
* **TypeScript:** Strict typing for robust, maintainable code.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for a clean, custom design system.
* **Framer Motion:** High-performance scroll-reveal animations and interactive gestures.
